# Telegram theming reference

my attempt to make a centralised key of theming properties in the various telegram apps. please feel free to message me with suggestions, or open a pull request

i've been doing this sporadically, which is why the formatting's a little messy. the telegram x sheet is the preferred formatting.

### useful miscellany:

* The section headers are ID'd with their own name, camel-case. To link to a section, make a link like so: `[Generic](#generic)`.
* Items prefixed with /?\ or /!\ are unknown - please message me if you discover their purpose
* Items postfixed with /?\ i am inferring their use, i'm not 100% sure
